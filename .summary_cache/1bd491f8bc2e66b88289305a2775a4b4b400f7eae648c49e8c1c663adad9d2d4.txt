French recommendations have been published on physical activity and nutrition for patients with digestive cancer. The FOLFOX6m regimen is more convenient and cost-effective than FOLFOX4 for non-metastatic colon cancer patients, with equivalent or better tolerance and higher 5-FU intensity. Studies have shown equivalent 3-year disease-free survival with FOLFOX6m compared to FOLFOX4 in stage III colon cancer patients.
