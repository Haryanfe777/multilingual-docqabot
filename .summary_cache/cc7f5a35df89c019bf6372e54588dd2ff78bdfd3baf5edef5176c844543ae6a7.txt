The use of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is effective for patients with stage III MSI cancer. However, combinations of irinotecan and 5-FU have not shown efficacy in the adjuvant setting. Raltitrexed is not recommended for adjuvant treatment of colon cancer due to increased toxicity. The combination of raltitrexed and oxaliplatin may be considered in metastatic situations for high-risk stage III patients, especially in cases of cardiac toxicity or DPD deficiency. Prescription of raltitrexed requires precautions considering renal function.
