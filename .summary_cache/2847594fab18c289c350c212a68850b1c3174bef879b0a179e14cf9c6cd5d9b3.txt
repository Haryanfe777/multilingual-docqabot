The text discusses the implementation of subtype markers in identifying various gene and protein characteristics, with a high correlation between block components indicating a unified signal. This validates DIABLO's integration. The text suggests including visual aids such as a heatmap or circos plot to illustrate multi-omics feature relationships. The paper's DIABLO example is compared, noting a similar error rate and feature signature. The MINT model's performance is also discussed, with varying accuracy rates for different classes. The text emphasizes the importance of gene selection and the consistency of these genes across all studies. The model's ability to learn a common pattern from all studies is highlighted, with the suggestion to include visual aids to show clustering by cell type across studies using the selected genes. The text concludes by noting the consistency of one gene's expression across all studies.
