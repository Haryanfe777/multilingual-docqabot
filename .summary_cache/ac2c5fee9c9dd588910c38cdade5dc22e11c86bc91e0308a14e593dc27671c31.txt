The MINT model, using a 22-gene signature, was able to distinguish human embryonic stem cells (hESC) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) with nearly the same accuracy as using 400 genes. This indicates that the selected genes captured the essential differences between the cell types. The MINT model avoids overfitting and can predict new samples' class, allowing for reliable classification of unknown stem cell samples. The model was consistent across four studies, even with each study having its own batch effects. The relative positions of cell types were analogous after integration, indicating the model wasn't overfit to any single study. The 22 genes were found to be reliable biomarkers with reproducible behavior, a crucial validation for multi-study integration.
