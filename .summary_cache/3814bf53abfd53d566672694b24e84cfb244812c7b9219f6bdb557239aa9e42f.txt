The text discusses criteria for genetic testing for H, POLE, and POLD1 mutations in individuals with colorectal polyps. Criteria include the number of polyps, age, family history, and specific features of the polyps. Mutations in APC are often seen in individuals with florid polyposis or desmoid tumors, while mutations in MUTYH are common in individuals with attenuated phenotype. Other rare predisposition syndromes, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and juvenile polyposis, are not covered in the text.
