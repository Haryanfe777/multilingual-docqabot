This text discusses non-metastatic colon cancer and the classification of tumor invasion based on proximity to the serosa. Tumors located less than 1 mm from the serosa are considered pT3, not pT4, with additional tissue sections recommended for accurate staging. Invasion of other organs or structures through the serosa is classified as T4b, with macroscopic adhesion to other structures classified as cT4b. Microscopic examination determines the histopathological classification.
