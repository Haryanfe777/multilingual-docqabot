The text describes the results of a study using the sPLS-DA model for cancer subtype classification. The model showed high accuracy in classifying samples by tumor type based on the expression of 340 signature genes. The model's accuracy was confirmed through various visualizations, such as a DA sample plot, an arrow plot, a clustered image map, and multi-class ROC curves. The study achieved approximately 100% classification accuracy, successfully identifying candidate genes for each cancer subtype. The paper also applied DIABLO to a TCGA breast cancer multi-omics dataset, deriving a highly correlated multi-omics signature that accurately differentiated three breast cancer subtypes. Despite the data having hundreds of features per block, this sparse multi-omics signature was very predictive, achieving a classification error rate of only 2.54% in cross-validation.
