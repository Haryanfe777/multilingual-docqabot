The text discusses studies comparing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for stage II and III colon cancer, including FOLFOX4 and LV5FU2. Results show no significant survival benefit with FOLFOX4 in stage II patients, but a potential improvement in survival for high-risk stage II patients. The IDEA collaboration evaluated the non-inferiority of 3 versus 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin for high-risk stage II colon cancer patients.
