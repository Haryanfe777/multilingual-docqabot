The FOLFOX4 regimen, consisting of 5-FU, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin, is more effective than LV5FU2 in adjuvant treatment for non-metastatic colorectal cancer, with improved survival rates and some neurotoxicity. Studies have shown that FOLFOX4 improves survival at 3 and 10 years compared to other regimens, and the addition of oxaliplatin in adjuvant chemotherapy has shown benefits in various patient subgroups.
