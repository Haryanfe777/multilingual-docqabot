The intern agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained during their internship, and not to use it for publication or disclosure to third parties without the host organization's consent. This applies during and after the internship period. The intern also agrees not to keep, remove, or copy any documents or software belonging to the host organization without prior approval. The host organization can request restrictions on the distribution of the intern's report or the removal of confidential information. If the intern's activities result in a copyrighted or industrial property work, a contract must be signed between the intern and the host organization if the latter wishes to use the work. The contract should specify the rights transferred, exclusivity requirements, intended use, media used, duration of rights transfer, and any compensation due to the intern.
