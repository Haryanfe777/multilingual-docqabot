The TNM-UICC classification is recommended for assessing colon cancer prognosis, with factors such as number of lymph nodes examined and invaded being important. Additional prognostic factors include vascular/lymphatic invasion, tumor grade, and molecular testing for MSI or dMMR phenotype, especially in stage II-III colon cancer patients over 75 years old. Detection of MSI phenotype is crucial for identifying Lynch syndrome and should be done using immunohistochemistry or molecular biology techniques.
