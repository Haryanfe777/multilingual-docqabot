The text discusses the classification of non-metastatic colon cancer and emphasizes the importance of adopting the new UICC classification for clinical research. It also outlines pre-therapeutic explorations, including the recommendation for a high-quality colonoscopy with biopsies of suspicious lesions and the consideration of endoscopic treatment for synchronous colorectal lesions not targeted for surgery. Resection of lesions within the planned surgical resection area is not necessary.
