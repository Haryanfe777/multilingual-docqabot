Pre-operative staging is necessary for advanced cancers, with imaging such as MRI and CT scans with contrast. For recto-sigmoid lesions, additional imaging may be needed to determine the height of the lesion and presence of lymph nodes. Colonoscopy and other imaging options are available for further evaluation. Family history should also be considered for screening for familial forms of cancer.
