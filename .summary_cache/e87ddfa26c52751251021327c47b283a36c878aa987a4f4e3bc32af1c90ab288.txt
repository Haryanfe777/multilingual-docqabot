Microsatellite markers must be positive to confirm MSI phenotype. Immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2 can help identify genetic alterations. Testing for BRAF V600E mutation or MLH1 promoter hypermethylation is recommended if MLH1 is extinguished. If BRAF V600E mutation or MLH1 promoter hypermethylation is present, MMR gene sequencing is not necessary. Constitutional MMR gene alterations can be identified through genetic testing after an oncogenetic consultation. Lynch syndrome variants include Muir-Torre syndrome and Turcot syndrome.
