The text outlines the responsibilities of an educational institution and a host organization in case of a work accident during an internship. The host organization must report any accidents to the educational institution within 48 hours. The coverage includes accidents that occur at the internship site, during travel to and from the site, and during any tasks assigned by the host organization. If any conditions are not met, the host organization is responsible for covering the intern against work accidents, commute accidents, and occupational diseases. The host organization must also provide appropriate insurance if the intern is working outside of the host organization or the host country. Both the host organization and the intern must have civil liability coverage. The intern is also required to have travel assistance insurance and individual accident insurance. If the intern uses a vehicle, the host organization or the intern must ensure it is insured. If the security conditions in the host country deteriorate, the intern must notify their school and leave the country. The intern's evaluation methods will be reviewed in such cases.
