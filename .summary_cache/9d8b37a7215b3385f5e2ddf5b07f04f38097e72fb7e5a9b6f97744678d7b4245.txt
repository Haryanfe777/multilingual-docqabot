The text discusses the potential use of biological parameters in predicting prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions for stage II colon cancer. It mentions the importance of molecular classification and monitoring residual disease using circulating tumor DNA as promising biomarkers for recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Prospective studies are ongoing to validate these approaches for adjuvant treatment of localized colon cancer.
