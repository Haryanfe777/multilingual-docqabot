The timing of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for colon cancer is important, with recommendations to start within 8 weeks and not beyond 5 months. The results of the IDEA study suggest reevaluating the use of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer. A non-inferiority analysis of six randomized studies involving 12,834 patients showed no significant difference between 3 months and 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin.
