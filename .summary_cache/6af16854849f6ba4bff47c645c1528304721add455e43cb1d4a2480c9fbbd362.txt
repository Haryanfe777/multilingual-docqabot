The establishment of molecular biology platforms for cancer testing allows routine access to tests for disease recurrence and treatment selection. Determining RAS, BRAF, and MSI status can provide prognostic information and guide therapeutic strategies, including targeted therapy and clinical trial selection. Systematic determination of MSI status in colorectal cancer is recommended, with encouragement for molecular biology studies and the use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples for testing.
