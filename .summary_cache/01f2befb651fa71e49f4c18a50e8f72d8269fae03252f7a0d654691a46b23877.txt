Treatment for Tis type lesions is sufficient with complete excision in one piece. For lesions with submucosal carcinoma, complete endoscopic resection in one piece is considered sufficient if certain criteria are met. Additional surgical treatment may be necessary if criteria are not met. Follow-up endoscopy is recommended if resection is incomplete or does not meet safety criteria. Surveillance strategy should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.
