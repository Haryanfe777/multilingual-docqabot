The study evaluated the benefits of enhanced surveillance strategies for colon cancer patients using imaging and ACE testing. The study found no significant difference in overall survival or recurrence-free survival between the groups. However, in patients with recurrent colon cancer, those in the ACE surveillance groups had a higher rate of curative surgery compared to those without ACE surveillance.
