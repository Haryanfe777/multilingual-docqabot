For stage II colon cancer at high relative risk of recurrence, 3 months of CAPOX is an alternative to 6 months of FOLFOX. Some high-risk stage II tumors may have worse prognosis than low-risk stage III tumors. Oxaliplatin has not shown significant improvement in survival in all stage II patients. MSI phenotype is associated with good prognosis in stage II colon cancer. Predictive value of molecular phenotype in adjuvant chemotherapy is unclear.
