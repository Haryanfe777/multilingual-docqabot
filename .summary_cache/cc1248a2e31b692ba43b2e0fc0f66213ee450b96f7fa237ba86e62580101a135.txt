The use of colonic stents in the therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer is not recommended as a first-line treatment. Surgical treatment is preferred for colonic obstruction, with consideration given to colonic stents in expert centers. In cases of T4 tumors with bladder or uterine involvement, a temporary stoma may be considered before chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, followed by resection. In cases of suspected liver metastases, intraoperative ultrasound and sampling are recommended.
