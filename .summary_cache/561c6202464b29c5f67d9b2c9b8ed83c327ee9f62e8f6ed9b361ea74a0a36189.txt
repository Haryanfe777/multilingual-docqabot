The DIABLO method was used to differentiate subtypes of data with hundreds of features per block, achieving a classification error rate of only 2.54%. This high accuracy rate indicates that integrating three omics layers improves the ability to distinguish subtypes. The method was particularly effective when combining mRNA and proteomics data, as opposed to using miRNA alone. The method also successfully aligned the latent representation of the three data types. Beyond accuracy, DIABLO was also effective in identifying biomarkers across omics, including known breast cancer drivers. The method provided insights into how these multi-omics features relate, revealing potential regulatory relationships.
