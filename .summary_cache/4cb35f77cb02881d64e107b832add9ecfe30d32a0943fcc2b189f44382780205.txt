Biopsies should be taken from lesions during endoscopy to determine the mutation status of genes KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF in colon cancer patients. Testing for MSI/dMMR status should also be considered for immunotherapy treatment. A sufficient number of biopsies should be taken for molecular testing, and extension staging should be done promptly. Onco-geriatric evaluation may be necessary for patients over 75 years old. Imaging tests such as CT scans with contrast are recommended for accurate staging before treatment.
