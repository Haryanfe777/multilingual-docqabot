The study found that for high-risk colon cancer patients, a 6-month FOLFOX treatment was more effective than a 3-month treatment, with a higher disease-free survival rate. However, for other groups, including low-risk colon cancer patients, no superiority or non-inferiority of treatment duration was demonstrated. The risk of neuropathy was significantly lower with a 3-month treatment, with differences in neurotoxicity rates between the two treatment durations. The study also validated the prognostic value of the immunoscore in stage III colon cancer patients receiving oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
