The text discusses the lack of survival benefit in using 18-FDG PET scan for surveillance of non-metastatic colorectal cancer patients post-surgery. Recurrence rates for metastatic cancer after 5-10 years are low, suggesting surveillance beyond 5 years may not be necessary. Recommendations for surveillance are based on expert opinions and are often not followed in practice. Monitoring of ACE levels is no longer recommended due to lack of proven benefit.
