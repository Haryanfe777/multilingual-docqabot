Patients with high relative risk of recurrence in stage II colon cancer were treated with CAPOX for either 3 or 6 months. Survival rates at 3 years were similar for both treatment durations, with better tolerance seen in the 3-month group. The choice of chemotherapy regimen was found to impact outcomes, with CAPOX showing equivalence between 3 and 6 months, while FOLFOX had better survival outcomes with 6 months of treatment but poorer tolerance.
