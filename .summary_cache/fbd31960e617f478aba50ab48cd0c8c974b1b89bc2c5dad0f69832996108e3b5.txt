Studies are ongoing to validate predictive biological factors for the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer. In stage III colon cancer, lymph node involvement is the most important prognostic factor. Adjuvant chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidines has been shown to reduce the risk of death by 12-16% at 5 years. LV5FU2 protocol is effective and better tolerated than high-dose FUFOL. 5-FU continuous infusion is also effective and better tolerated than low-dose FUFOL.
