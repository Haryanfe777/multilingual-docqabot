The text discusses the application of DIABLO, a multi-omics integration tool, on TCGA breast cancer data. The tool was able to find a highly correlated, discriminative multi-omics signature. The results showed better separation in mRNA/protein than miRNA. The paper also discussed a MINT case study that combined four independent stem cell datasets. The study aimed to find a gene signature that consistently discriminates three cell types across all studies. The final MINT model selected 22 genes as a cross-study biomarker signature for cell identity. The model achieved a balanced error rate of 39% with two components, with most errors coming from distinguishing two similar classes. The second component specifically helped distinguish Human Embryonic Stem Cells from induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. The error rate was comparable to using all genes.
