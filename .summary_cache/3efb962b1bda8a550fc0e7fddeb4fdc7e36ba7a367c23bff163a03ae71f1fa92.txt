The text discusses the criteria for identifying Lynch syndrome, a hereditary cancer syndrome. The Amsterdam II criteria are not sensitive enough to identify all patients with Lynch syndrome, so less restrictive criteria have been proposed. These include expanded clinical criteria and molecular testing for microsatellite instability. At least 2 out of 5 tested markers must be positive to confirm the MSI phenotype.
