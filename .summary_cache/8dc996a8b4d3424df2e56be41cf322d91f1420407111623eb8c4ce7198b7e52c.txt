Adjuvant therapy in stage II tumors should be considered based on chemotherapy toxicity and benefit-risk ratio. Survival benefit is moderate, ranging from 2 to 5% depending on the risk of recurrence. Tumors should be categorized based on their relative risk of recurrence, with low or moderate risk tumors having favorable prognostic factors and high risk tumors having unfavorable prognostic factors. The presence of certain factors may not always indicate a high risk of recurrence.
