The text discusses the importance of identifying molecular markers in tumor cells to determine predisposition to certain forms of cancer. Testing for microsatellite instability and immunohistochemistry can help identify genetic alterations. Specific genetic tests are recommended based on the results of these initial tests, with a blood test for genetic mutations being offered after an oncogenetic consultation.
