The use of colonic stents as a "bridge" to surgery in cases of colorectal cancer is not recommended as a first-line treatment. Surgical treatment of obstruction is preferred, with colostomy being the preferred option for left-sided lesions. In cases of T4 tumors involving the bladder or uterus, a temporary stoma may be considered before starting chemotherapy or radiotherapy, with resection surgery performed later. This option should be discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting before surgery. Tumors invading the uterus or bladder do not necessarily affect resectability, unlike those invading the sacrum, ureters, or iliac vessels.
