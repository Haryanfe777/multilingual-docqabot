The text outlines the conditions under which interns abroad can benefit from French legislation providing coverage for workplace accidents. The internship must not exceed six months, not provide remuneration that could open rights to work injury protection in the host country, and must take place exclusively within the signing organization and the foreign host country. If these conditions are not met, the host organization is responsible for the intern's welfare protection and must report any workplace accidents. The coverage applies to accidents occurring within the internship location, during working hours, on commutes, and during the first and final trips to and from the intern's residence. If any conditions are not met, the host organization must cover the intern for workplace and travel accidents, and occupational disease. The host organization must also notify the educational institution of any accidents and provide appropriate insurance for assignments outside of the host organization or country.
