For stage II colon cancer with high risk of recurrence, treatment options include capecitabine or oxaliplatin-based regimens. Oxaliplatin should be stopped if grade 2 neurotoxicity occurs. Adjuvant chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin is recommended for certain cases. Genotyping of DPYD gene is advised for abnormal DPD phenotype. Moderate physical activity is recommended for patients.
