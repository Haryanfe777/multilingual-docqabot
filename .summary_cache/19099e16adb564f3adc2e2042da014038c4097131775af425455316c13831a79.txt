Patients with stage II colon cancer were treated mainly with CAPOX. A 3-month treatment showed significantly better neurological tolerance compared to a 6-month treatment. Survival rates at 3 years were similar between the two treatment durations, with CAPOX showing equivalence between 3 and 6 months. FOLFOX showed better survival rates with a 6-month treatment but with poorer tolerance. Therefore, for stage II colon cancer with a high risk of recurrence, a 3-month CAPOX treatment is a viable alternative to a 6-month FOLFOX treatment.
