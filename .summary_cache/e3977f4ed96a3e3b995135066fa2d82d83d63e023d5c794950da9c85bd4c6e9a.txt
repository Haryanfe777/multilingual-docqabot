The text discusses the importance of preserving tumor DNA for determining RAS, BRAF, and MSI status in colorectal cancer patients, which can guide treatment decisions and patient selection for targeted therapies. Systematic determination of MSI status is recommended in all colorectal cancers, with molecular biology studies encouraged. Fixation with formalin and paraffin blocks is preferred for testing. Treatment recommendations for non-metastatic colon cancer are also provided.
