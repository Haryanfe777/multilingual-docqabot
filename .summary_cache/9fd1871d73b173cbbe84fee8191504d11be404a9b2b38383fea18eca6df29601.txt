A study on adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin in colon cancer patients showed that those with high levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had better 3-year survival rates. Long-term data from the study confirmed the effectiveness and tolerability of the treatment. A 3-month chemotherapy duration had a minimal impact on overall survival compared to a 6-month duration, with a slight difference of 0.4% and reduced neurotoxicity.
