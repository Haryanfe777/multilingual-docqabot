Micro-metastases are tumor foci between 0.2 mm and 2 mm in size, classified as pN1. Isolated tumor cells are single tumor cells or small clusters measuring < 0.2 mm. T4a stage is defined by tumor extension through the visceral peritoneum. T4b stage involves tumor cells in continuity with the serosa or reaching the serosal surface with reactive phenomena.
