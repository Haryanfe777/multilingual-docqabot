Complete endoscopic resection of a degenerated adenoma is sufficient treatment, especially if done in one piece. For lesions with submucosal carcinoma, complete endoscopic resection is considered sufficient only if certain criteria are met, including superficial submucosal invasion and absence of certain pathological features. Surgical treatment after endoscopic resection should be discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting.
