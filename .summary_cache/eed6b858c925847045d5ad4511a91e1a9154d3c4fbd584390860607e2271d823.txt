Patients with stage II colon cancer with poor prognostic factors may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, especially if they do not have a favorable molecular phenotype. Factors such as MSI status, tumor stage, number of lymph nodes analyzed, and genomic profile can influence the risk of recurrence. Studies like MOSAIC have compared different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for stage II and III colon cancer patients.
