The text discusses the use of the DIABLO framework for multi-omics data integration in identifying biomarkers in breast cancer subtypes. The framework showed that 18 miRNAs were positively correlated with component 1, while 9 of 16 mRNAs and 3 of 5 proteins were negatively correlated. This suggests an inverse relationship between a miRNA signature and a gene/protein signature. The framework also identified two main clusters of multi-omics features, indicating at least two molecular "programs" characterizing the subtypes. The DIABLO's multi-omics signature was highly correlated and discriminant, with a classification accuracy of about 97%. The results demonstrate that using multi-omics data provides a more comprehensive view and allows for the identification of robust and biologically meaningful multi-layer biomarkers.
