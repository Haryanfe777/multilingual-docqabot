The MINT analysis identified a stable 22-gene signature that can differentiate fibroblasts from pluripotent cells and distinguish between induced and embryonic pluripotent cells. This signature was consistent across multiple studies, indicating its reliability as a biomarker. The analysis also showed reasonable error rates and increased confidence in the discovered markers due to a larger sample size. The MINT approach is particularly useful in clinical validation scenarios where markers need to generalize to new patient cohorts. The results were visualized in a series of plots and tables, demonstrating the signature's ability to separate the classes in a balanced way across all datasets.
