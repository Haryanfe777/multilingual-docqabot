The text discusses the results of using the mixOmics package for data analysis. The results were consistent with the original paper, indicating the methods are stable and the implementation was successful. Feature selection simplified models without losing accuracy, improving interpretability. Data integration improved subtype discrimination and revealed multi-modal correlations. The use of mixOmics effectively addressed the challenges of high-dimensional, multi-source data. Future considerations include extending the DIABLO method to more omics and testing the MINT method on more than four studies. The text also suggests the potential for these methods to be applied to microbiome data.
