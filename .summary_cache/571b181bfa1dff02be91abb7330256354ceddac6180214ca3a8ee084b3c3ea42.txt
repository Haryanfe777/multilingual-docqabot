Aspirin treatment has been shown to significantly increase recurrence-free survival and overall survival in patients with stage II-III colorectal cancer with an activating mutation in the PI3KCA gene.

Additionally, moderate physical activity before and after diagnosis has been associated with improved overall and cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer patients.
