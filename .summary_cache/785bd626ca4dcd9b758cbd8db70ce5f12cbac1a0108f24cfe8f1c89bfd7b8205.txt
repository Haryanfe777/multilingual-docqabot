The text discusses the classification of cancer using the TNM system proposed by AJCC and UICC. It is recommended that pathologists specify the classification they use in their reports. Examining at least 12 regional lymph nodes is recommended to determine the N status. The prognosis is better with a higher number of lymph nodes examined, especially for stages II and III. The optimal number of lymph nodes to examine may depend on the tumor stage.
