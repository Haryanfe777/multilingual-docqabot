Patients with stage II colon cancer at high risk of recurrence may benefit from a 3-month CAPOX chemotherapy regimen instead of a 6-month FOLFOX regimen, despite potential neurologic side effects. The prognosis for stage II colon cancer with MSI molecular phenotype is generally good, but the predictive value of this parameter for adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy is uncertain. Determining MSI status can help guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for stage II colon cancer patients with poor prognostic factors.
