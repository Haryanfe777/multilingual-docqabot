The study found that adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve overall survival for patients with stage II colon cancer, especially for those over 70 years old. It is recommended to determine the MSI or dMMR status to guide the decision on adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with poor prognostic factors. Patients with a MSI or dMMR molecular phenotype may not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
