Endoscopic resection of lesions in the surgical resection zone is not necessary. Tattooing of lesions for surgical removal is recommended. Immunohistochemistry and molecular testing should be done to determine protein extinction and microsatellite instability. Biopsies should be taken for mutation testing in advanced cancer cases. Immunotherapy may be considered based on the results.
