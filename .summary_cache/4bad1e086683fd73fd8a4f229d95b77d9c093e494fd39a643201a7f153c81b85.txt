FOLFOX6 modified (also known as simplified FOLFOX4) and CAPOX (also known as XELOX) are chemotherapy regimens used for colon cancer. Surveillance after curative treatment is important as recurrences are common, with about 80% occurring within 3 years. Clinical, radiological, and endoscopic surveillance is recommended, with abdominal ultrasound being the most cost-effective method for detecting liver metastases.
