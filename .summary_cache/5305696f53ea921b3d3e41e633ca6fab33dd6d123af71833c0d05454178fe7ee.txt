Patients over 70 with stage II colon cancer may not benefit from adding oxaliplatin to 5-FU chemotherapy, but pooled analysis suggests a benefit for those over 70. Studies on adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer in patients over 75 or 80 are ongoing. Consideration of comorbidities and life expectancy is important before starting treatment. Oral 5-FU derivative cap√©citabine is as effective as FUFOL for survival without recurrence and overall survival with fewer side effects.
