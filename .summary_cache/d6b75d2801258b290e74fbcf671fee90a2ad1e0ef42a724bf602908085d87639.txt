A study evaluated the immunoscore for quantifying lymphocytic infiltration in non-metastatic colon cancer, confirming its prognostic value. Other histoprognostic scores and molecular classifications have also shown promise in predicting patient outcomes. However, the potential impact of these biological parameters on treatment decisions, such as adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk stage II colon cancers, is still being investigated.
