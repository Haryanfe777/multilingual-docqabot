Patients with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had the best 3-year survival without recurrence in a study on adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin. Long-term data from the study confirmed previous results on efficacy and tolerability. A 3-month chemotherapy duration had a minimal impact on overall survival compared to a 6-month duration, with slightly higher survival rates at 5 years and reduced neurological toxicity.
