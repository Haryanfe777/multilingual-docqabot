The text discusses the effectiveness of the FOLFOX4 regimen in treating colorectal cancer, comparing it to the LV5FU2 regimen in the MOSAIC trial. Results show a significant improvement in survival without relapse with FOLFOX4, despite some neurotoxicity. Studies also support the use of oxaliplatin in adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly in stage III colorectal cancer.
