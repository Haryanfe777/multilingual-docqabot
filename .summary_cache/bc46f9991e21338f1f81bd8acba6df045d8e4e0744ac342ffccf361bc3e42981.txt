The literature review discusses various techniques for feature extraction and classification in the context of pose estimation and classification. These include flow vectors, angles between anchor joints, normalized distance vectors, SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), and LoG (Laplacian of Gaussian). The review also covers the use of cosine similarity for comparing pose vectors. Two models are highlighted: a CNN-LSTM model by Rani & Devarakonda (2022) for dance pose classification, and an LSTM-based model by Srivastava, Umrao, and Yadav (2024) for yoga pose classification. Both models use a combination of convolutional layers, LSTM layers, and dense layers for feature extraction and classification. Training details for both models are also provided.
