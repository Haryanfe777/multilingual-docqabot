The text discusses the use of adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU and oxaliplatin in patients over 70 years old with stage II colon cancer. While the benefit of adding oxaliplatin for older patients is not well-established, a pooled analysis of four controlled studies suggests a benefit for those over 70. Further studies are needed to determine the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients over 75 or 80 years old.
