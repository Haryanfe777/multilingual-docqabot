Preoperative incomplete coloscopy should be completed within 6 months postoperatively. Options for further evaluation include colo-scanner with water distension, thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan with colonic opacification in case of acute obstruction, ACE level measurement for prognostic value, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy for right colon cancer near the duodenum. Family history of colorectal and other cancers should be assessed for Lynch syndrome.
