The text discusses the consideration of age in determining the need for adjuvant chemotherapy, emphasizing that physiological age is more important than chronological age. There is limited data on the evaluation of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients, and the decision to administer chemotherapy should be based on life expectancy and potential benefits. Studies have shown that adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU can be beneficial for patients over 70 years old without significant increase in toxicity. However, in some cases, such as in the QUASAR study, no benefit was observed in patients over 70 years old with stage II cancer.
