For patients over 70 with stage II colon cancer, the benefit of adding oxaliplatin to 5-FU chemotherapy is not established, but pooled analysis of controlled studies suggests a benefit for those over 70. Studies on the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy beyond age 75 or 80 are ongoing. Treatment with oral 5-FU derivative cap√©citabine is as effective as FUFOL for survival without recurrence at 3 years and overall survival at 5 years with fewer side effects.
