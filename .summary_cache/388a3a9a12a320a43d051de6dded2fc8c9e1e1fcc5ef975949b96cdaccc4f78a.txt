The presence of certain proteins in a tumor suggests a MSI phenotype, which can be confirmed through immuno-histochemical analysis. Determining the MSI status of a tumor in older patients can have prognostic and therapeutic implications. Testing for BRAF and MSI status in recurrent disease can guide treatment decisions and potentially lead to targeted therapies. The availability of molecular biology platforms allows for routine testing and quick determination of RAS status. These tests also provide prognostic information and guide therapeutic strategies, including targeted therapies and participation in clinical trials.
