The pensions legislation (Law No. 2014-40 of January 20, 2014) allows students with paid internships to have their work validated within two calendar quarters, provided they pay a fee. The student must apply within two years of the internship's end, presenting a certificate that details the internship's duration and total stipend amount. Further details about the fee and application process can be requested from the Social Security administration.
