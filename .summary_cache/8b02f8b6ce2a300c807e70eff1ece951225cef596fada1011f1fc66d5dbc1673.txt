Various studies have shown improved overall survival in stage II or III colon cancer patients with adjuvant treatment using oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin. The duration of adjuvant chemotherapy, BRAF mutation, and mismatch repair status also impact outcomes in colon cancer patients. Pembrolizumab and bevacizumab have shown promising results as adjuvant treatments for colon cancer. Deficient mismatch repair phenotype is a prognostic factor for colorectal cancer in elderly patients.
