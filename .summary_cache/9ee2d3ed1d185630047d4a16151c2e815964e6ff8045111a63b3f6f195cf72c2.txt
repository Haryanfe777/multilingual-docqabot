The text discusses the surveillance of non-metastatic colorectal cancer patients after curative surgery, with low rates of metastatic recurrence between 5 and 10 years post-surgery. Recommendations for intensive surveillance include clinical exams every 3 months for 3 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, abdominal ultrasound, chest x-ray, and monitoring of tumor markers. Surveillance is not recommended beyond 5 years, and monitoring is especially important for stage II and III colorectal cancers.
