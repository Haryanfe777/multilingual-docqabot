Different chemotherapy regimens for colon cancer include FOLFOX6, CAPOX, and XELOX. Surveillance after curative treatment is important as 80% of recurrences occur within 3 years. Around 25% of recurrences can be treated curatively. Clinical, radiological, and endoscopic surveillance is recommended for patients able to undergo further treatment. The use of the ACE marker for monitoring is limited, and abdominal ultrasound is the most cost-effective method for detecting liver metastases.
