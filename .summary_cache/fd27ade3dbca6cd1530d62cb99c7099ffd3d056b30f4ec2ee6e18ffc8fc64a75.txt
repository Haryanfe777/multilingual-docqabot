The text discusses the importance of determining the molecular tumor phenotype in patients with Lynch syndrome using immunohistochemistry and molecular biology techniques. Absence of MMR protein expression indicates a MSI phenotype, which can guide genetic diagnosis. Testing for MSI status in elderly patients can have prognostic and therapeutic implications, and access to molecular cancer testing is facilitated by national platforms.
