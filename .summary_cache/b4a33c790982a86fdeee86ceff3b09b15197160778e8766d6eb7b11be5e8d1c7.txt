The TNM classification system is essential for predicting the prognosis of colon cancer, with additional factors such as vascular/lymphatic invasion, nerve invasion, grade, tumor budding, and molecular markers like RAS, MSI, and BRAF being important. Testing for MSI or dMMR phenotype is recommended for stage II-III colon cancer management due to its prognostic value and relevance for Lynch syndrome detection. MSI prevalence increases with age, with sporadic and Lynch syndrome-related cases. Immunohistochemistry or molecular biology techniques can determine MSI status based on MMR protein expression levels.
