A study compared different surveillance methods for non-metastatic colon cancer patients, including blood tests and imaging. No significant differences in overall survival were found between the groups. However, patients with recurrence who had blood tests had a higher rate of curative surgery. PET scans were not found to be useful in routine surveillance for these patients.
