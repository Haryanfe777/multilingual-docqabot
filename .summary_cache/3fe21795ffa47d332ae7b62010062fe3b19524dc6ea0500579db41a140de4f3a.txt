Factors such as tumor differentiation, presence of isolated neoplastic cells in lymph nodes, and certain biological markers can impact the prognosis of colorectal cancer. However, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy based on these factors is not proven. New biological markers associated with a good prognosis have been identified, but tests like Oncoprint® and Oncotype DX® are not recommended in France. The prognostic value of CDX2 and mutations in RAS and BRAF V600E should be further studied for stage II colorectal cancer.
