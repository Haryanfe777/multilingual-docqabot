Treatment plan for stage III colon cancer includes 2-hour infusion of G 5% in Y of folinic acid on day 1 of LV5FU2 every 2 weeks for 12 cycles. Adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX6m or CAPOX is recommended, with options for patients over 70 years old. Consider LV5FU2s or capecitabine in case of oxaliplatin contraindications. Clinical trials are ongoing to assess DPD deficiency before 5-FU/cap√©citabine administration. Adjustments in doses may be necessary based on DPD status. Additional treatment options are available based on tumor mutation status and patient characteristics.
