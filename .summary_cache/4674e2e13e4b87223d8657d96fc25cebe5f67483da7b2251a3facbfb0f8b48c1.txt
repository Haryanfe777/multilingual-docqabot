A study comparing 3 months versus 6 months of chemotherapy for colon cancer found that 3 months of CAPOX is as effective as 6 months for low-risk patients, with a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 75.9% versus 74.8%. However, 3 months of FOLFOX was less effective than 6 months, with a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 73.6% versus 76%. Overall, 3 months of CAPOX or FOLFOX was non-inferior to 6 months for low-risk colon cancer patients.
