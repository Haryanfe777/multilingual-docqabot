Various studies have shown the potential of circulating tumor DNA as a marker for recurrence risk and benefit of adjuvant therapy in localized colon cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy has been found to be effective in colon cancer patients with microsatellite instability, as well as in elderly patients with stage II disease. Delay in adjuvant chemotherapy may also provide a survival advantage in stage III colon cancer. Capecitabine has been shown to be effective as adjuvant treatment for stage III colon cancer.
