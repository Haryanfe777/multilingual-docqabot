The text discusses the use of chemotherapy in patients over 70 with colon cancer, recommending a combination of fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin as an alternative to fluoropyrimidines alone. It also suggests genotyping the DPYD gene in patients with abnormal DPD phenotype, encouraging moderate physical activity, and considering raltitrexed and oxaliplatin for certain cases. Clinical trials are also mentioned, including a study on adjuvant chemotherapy in older patients with stage III colon cancer.
