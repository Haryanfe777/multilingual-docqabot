Classification and molecular profiling of colon cancer may lead to personalized treatment strategies in the future. Monitoring residual disease using circulating tumor DNA shows promise as a biomarker for recurrence and overall survival in localized colon cancer patients. However, no definitive biological predictor of adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy has been identified yet. Studies are ongoing to evaluate the role of these factors in treatment decisions for localized colon cancer.
