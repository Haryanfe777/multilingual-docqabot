The text discusses the importance of measuring uracil levels to identify DPD enzyme deficiency, which can impact the use of fluoropyrimidines in cancer treatment. High uracil levels indicate complete DPD deficiency, making fluoropyrimidines contraindicated. Partial DPD deficiency requires adjusting fluoropyrimidine dosage based on uracil levels and other risk factors. Additionally, calcium/magnesium infusions are ineffective in preventing oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.
