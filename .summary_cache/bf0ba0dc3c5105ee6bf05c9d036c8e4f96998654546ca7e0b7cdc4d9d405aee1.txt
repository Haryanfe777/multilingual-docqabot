Raltitrexed is not recommended for adjuvant treatment of colon cancer due to lack of non-inferiority compared to 5-FU/folinic acid. However, it may be considered in metastatic situations, especially for high-risk patients. Targeted therapies like bevacizumab and cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy have not shown significant benefits in most studies.
