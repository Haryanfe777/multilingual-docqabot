Internship leave and interruptions are subject to the host organization's regulations. Any temporary interruption, such as illness or unjustified absence, must be reported to the school in writing. All parties involved in the internship agreement must be notified of any interruptions. If agreed upon, the internship can be extended to fulfill the original duration, provided it does not exceed the legal maximum of six months and ends before the academic year. If any party wishes to terminate the internship, they must inform the other parties in writing, and a final decision will be made after consultation. The intern must also respect confidentiality, refraining from using any collected information for publication or disclosure without the host organization's consent.
