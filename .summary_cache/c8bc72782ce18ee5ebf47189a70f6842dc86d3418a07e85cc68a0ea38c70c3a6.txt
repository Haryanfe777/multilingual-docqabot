Chapter 3 of TNCD discusses the importance of conducting a sufficient number of endoscopic biopsies for the management of non-metastatic colon cancer. It emphasizes the need for a timely extension assessment and tailored treatment decisions based on individual patient factors. Diagnostic tests such as clinical examination, CT scans, and MRI may be necessary to determine the extent of the disease and guide treatment strategies. Additionally, specific imaging techniques like rectal MRI may be required for accurate staging and surgical planning.
