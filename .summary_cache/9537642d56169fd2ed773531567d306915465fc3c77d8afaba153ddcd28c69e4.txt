Various studies have been conducted on the treatment and prognosis of non-metastatic colon cancer, including the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, artificial intelligence-guided tissue analysis, plasma cell-free DNA analysis, tumor microsatellite-instability status, and postoperative surveillance. The effectiveness of different treatment approaches, such as irinotecan fluorouracil plus leucovorin and adjuvant chemotherapy in older patients, has also been evaluated.
