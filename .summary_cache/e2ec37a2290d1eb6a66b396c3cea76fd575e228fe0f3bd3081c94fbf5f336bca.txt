The use of adjuvant therapy with oxaliplatin may be effective for patients with stage III MSI colon cancer. Combinations of irinotecan and 5-FU have not shown efficacy in the adjuvant setting. Raltitrexed is not recommended for adjuvant treatment of colon cancer due to increased toxicity. However, the combination of raltitrexed and oxaliplatin may be considered in certain cases, such as high-risk stage III patients or those with cardiac toxicity or DPD deficiency. Careful monitoring of renal function is necessary when prescribing raltitrexed.
