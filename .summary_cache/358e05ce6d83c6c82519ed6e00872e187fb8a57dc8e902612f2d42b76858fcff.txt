The text discusses the importance of testing for mismatch repair proteins in tumor samples to determine the presence of microsatellite instability (MSI) and guide genetic diagnosis. It also highlights the significance of determining MSI status in elderly patients for prognostic and therapeutic reasons. The availability of molecular biology platforms across the country allows for routine access to these tests, which can also be used to determine RAS status in recurrent disease for potential treatment with anti-EGFR therapy.
