The text discusses the results of studies comparing the effectiveness of FOLFOX4 and LV5FU2 in treating high-risk stage II colon cancer, as well as the non-inferiority of 3-month versus 6-month adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin. The studies found that FOLFOX4 had a statistically non-significant improvement in disease-free survival and overall survival at 10 years in high-risk stage II colon cancer patients. The majority of patients in the studies were treated with CAPOX, and a 3-month treatment was found to have better neurological tolerance.
