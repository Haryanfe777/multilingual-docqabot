The text discusses the consistency of gene expression across multiple studies, using GENE123 as an example. It also compares the results of the study with those of a previous paper, noting that the findings were similar, with a BER of approximately 0.39 and a 22-gene signature with consistent weights. The study confirms that MINT avoids overfitting and that the results align well quantitatively with the previous paper. The feature sets found were very similar to those reported in the previous paper, with identical counts and presumably the same major genes. Any minor differences in the study were attributed to random CV splits, parameter grid choices, or package version. Overall, the differences were minimal, indicating the methods are stable.
