It is recommended to offer tissue testing for all patients undergoing surgery or biopsies. For advanced cancer cases, mutation testing for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF genes should be done, along with MSI/dMMR testing for potential immunotherapy treatment. Sufficient biopsies should be taken for molecular testing, and extension staging should be done promptly. Onco-geriatric evaluation is recommended for patients over 75 years old. Clinical examination and imaging tests are also important for diagnosis and treatment planning.
