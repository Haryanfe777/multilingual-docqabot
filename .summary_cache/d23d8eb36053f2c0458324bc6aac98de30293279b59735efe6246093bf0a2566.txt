The text outlines the stipend and benefits granted to an intern, which are determined by the laws in the host country. The intern remains under their previous social welfare protection during the internship. If the internship is conducted abroad, it must be reported to the Social Security administration. The intern's health insurance coverage depends on their origin and the location of the internship. For internships within the European Economic Area (EEA), students need to apply for a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). For internships in Quebec, French students must request a specific form. In other cases, students can be reimbursed for medical expenses by their student Social Security Agency. It is advised that students obtain additional health insurance coverage for their internships.
