The text discusses the performance and results of different models in various studies. The final 2-component model showed a Fibroblast error rate of 0%, hESC of approximately 67%, and hiPSC of around 50%. The model effectively separated Fibroblasts from hiPSC and hESC, with hiPSC and hESC being differentiable. The sPLS-DA model achieved 100% training accuracy with three components and perfectly separated the four tumor classes. It selected 340 genes out of 2308. The DIABLO model achieved approximately 97-98% accuracy in classifying breast tumor subtypes with an error rate of around 2.5%. It found a multi-omics signature of 16 mRNAs, 18 miRNAs, and 5 proteins on component 1. The study emphasizes that integration helped improve the accuracy of the models.
