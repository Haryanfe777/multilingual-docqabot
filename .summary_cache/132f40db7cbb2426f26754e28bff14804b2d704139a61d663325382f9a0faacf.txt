Pre-operative staging is necessary for advanced cancers. Imaging techniques such as MRI and coloscopy are recommended for precise diagnosis. Additional options include colo-scanner, thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan, and ACE level testing. Screening for familial forms of cancer is important, especially for Lynch syndrome.
