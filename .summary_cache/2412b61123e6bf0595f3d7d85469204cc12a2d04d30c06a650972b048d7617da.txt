The text discusses the use of oral fluoropyrimidines as an alternative to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in colon cancer treatment. Both FOLFOX and CAPOX regimens are considered standard for stage III colon cancer, with CAPOX having the advantage of not requiring an implantable port. In low-risk stage III colon cancer, a 3-month CAPOX regimen may be sufficient, while high-risk cases may require 6 months of FOLFOX or CAPOX. Capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine, can be challenging to administer and may cause severe toxicity in elderly patients, necessitating careful monitoring of renal function.
