A study showed that a 3-month chemotherapy regimen resulted in lower rates of neurotoxicity compared to a 6-month regimen, with significant differences in grade 2 and 3 neurotoxicity. Additionally, high levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with better 3-year survival rates in patients with stage III colorectal cancer receiving adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
