The text discusses the histopathological classification of colon cancer based on the depth of infiltration. It also explains the presence of tumor nodules in the surrounding tissue and their classification based on histological features. The presence of these nodules does not change the T category but can affect the N category if no metastases are found in regional lymph nodes.
