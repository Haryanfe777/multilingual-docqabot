At the end of an internship, the host organization fills out an evaluation form about the intern's performance and returns it to the reference teacher. The intern must present their professional experience according to the continuous assessment methods of their training. The host organization's tutor or any member who visits the educational institution for the preparation, execution, and validation of the internship is not entitled to any compensation from the educational institution. Any disputes will be governed by French law and unresolved disputes will be subject to the jurisdiction of the competent French courts.
