The study found that for high-risk colon tumors, a 6-month FOLFOX treatment was more effective than a 3-month treatment. However, for other groups, including high-risk colon tumors treated with CAPOX and low-risk colon tumors treated with FOLFOX, no superiority of treatment duration was demonstrated. The risk of neuropathy was significantly lower in the 3-month treatment group. The study also validated the prognostic value of the immunoscore in stage III patients receiving adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
