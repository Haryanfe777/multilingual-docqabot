The text outlines the procedures at the end of an internship. The host organization is required to issue a certificate indicating the duration of the internship and the stipend paid, if any. The intern is invited to submit an assessment of the quality of the internship, which does not impact their evaluation or certification. The host organization also needs to fill out an assessment form on the intern's activity. The intern must return their professional situation scenario according to the continuous monitoring of their course. The academic supervisor or any member of the host organization cannot claim reimbursement or compensation from the educational institution.
