The text discusses two studies. The first study, conducted in 2022, presents a system for estimating and classifying classical dance poses using a convolution neural network-long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) network for video sequences. The second study, projected for 2024, focuses on real-time yoga pose classification using a 3-D Pose Estimation Model with LSTM. Both studies are in the field of multimedia tools and applications.
