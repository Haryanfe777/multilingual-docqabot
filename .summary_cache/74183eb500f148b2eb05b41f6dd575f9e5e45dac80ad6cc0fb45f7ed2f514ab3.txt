The text describes three methods for dimension reduction and biomarker discovery: Multi Omics sPLS-DA, DIABLO, and MINT. Multi Omics sPLS-DA uses PLS-DA and Lasso feature selection to find latent components that separate classes while selecting a small set of features. DIABLO is a multi-block PLS-DA that integrates multiple data types measured on the same samples, maximizing correlation between components of different data blocks and discriminating outcomes. MINT is a multi-study PLS-DA that integrates data from different studies to find a common discriminant signature, using a leave-one-study-out strategy to avoid overfitting. The text also discusses a study that used sPLS-DA on a gene expression dataset of 63 childhood tumor samples, achieving near-perfect discrimination of the four tumor types with an overall error rate of essentially 0%. The method selected only a small fraction of genes as the discriminative signature, demonstrating its ability to identify biomarkers without sacrificing accuracy.
