The text discusses genetic mutations associated with hereditary colorectal polyposis, including mutations in the genes POLE and POLD1. It recommends genetic testing for the genes APC, MUTYH, POLE, and POLD1 in individuals with specific criteria, such as a high number of colorectal adenomatous polyps or a family history of colorectal cancer. A mutation in the APC gene is often observed in cases of florid polyposis or successive generations affected.
