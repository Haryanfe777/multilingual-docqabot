The text discusses the potential use of biological parameters in predicting prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions for colon cancer, including the activation of the TGFÎ² pathway and angiogenesis. It also mentions the potential for more precise molecular classification of colon cancers to tailor treatment strategies, such as different treatments for BRAF mutated, MSI, and HER2 amplified tumors. Monitoring residual disease using circulating tumor DNA in the blood is seen as a promising biomarker for recurrence-free and overall survival, as well as for monitoring adjuvant chemotherapy. Prospective studies are ongoing to validate the use of circulating tumor DNA in the adjuvant treatment of localized colon cancer.
