The use of systemic therapy should be considered for locally advanced tumors deemed inoperable or at the limit of resectability. In cases of colon cancer revealed by an obstruction, colonic stenting is an option but not recommended as first-line treatment. For T4 tumors involving the bladder or uterus, a temporary stoma may be created before starting chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, followed by surgical resection. Resectability is not a concern for tumors invading the uterus or bladder, unlike those invading the sacrum, ureters, or iliac vessels.
