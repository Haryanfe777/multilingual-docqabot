Abdominal ultrasound is cost-effective for detecting liver metastases, but its sensitivity can be affected by technical difficulties or tumor characteristics. Chest x-rays are not sensitive for detecting lung metastases, while CT scans are more effective for both lung and liver metastases. Studies show mixed results on the benefits of surveillance strategies involving regular imaging and tumor marker testing, with some suggesting a potential benefit in terms of recurrence but no clear survival advantage. Recent studies, including PRODIGE 13, do not support the use of intensive surveillance strategies involving CT scans and tumor marker testing for improved survival.
