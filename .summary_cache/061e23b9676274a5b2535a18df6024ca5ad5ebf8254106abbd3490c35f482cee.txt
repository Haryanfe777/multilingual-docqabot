The long-term results of the IDEA study on non-metastatic colon cancer show that a 3-month chemotherapy duration has a minimal impact on overall survival compared to a 6-month duration, with no significant difference in survival rates at 5 years. Toxicity, particularly neurological, is reduced with a shorter treatment duration.
