The text discusses health insurance coverage for interns working abroad. The host organization may provide health coverage under local law, which is in addition to rights granted under French law. If the host organization does not provide coverage, the intern's coverage is exclusively provided under the French student coverage framework. Interns are advised to get additional health insurance that is valid for the country and duration of the internship. For internships within the European Economic Area, students should apply for the European Health Insurance Card. For internships in Quebec, French students should apply for form SE401Q. In all other cases, students can be reimbursed for health expenses by their student social security fund based on French care rates.
