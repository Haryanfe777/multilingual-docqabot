The study compared the efficacy of 3-month versus 6-month CAPOX or FOLFOX chemotherapy regimens in high-risk colon cancer patients. The 3-month regimen was non-inferior in low-risk tumors but inferior in high-risk tumors. The 6-month FOLFOX regimen was superior in high-risk tumors. Neuropathy risk was lower in the 3-month regimen.
